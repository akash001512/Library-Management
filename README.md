# 📚 Library Management System (Java)

## 📌 Overview

    The Library Management System is a menu-driven Java console application that helps manage library books efficiently.
    
    It allows users to add different types of books, view all available books, and search for books using their title.
    
    This project demonstrates strong understanding of Java fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
  
  ### Prerequisites:
    
    Java JDK installed (Java 8 or higher)
    Command Prompt / Terminal
    
    Any IDE (optional): IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code
  
  ### Steps
    
    javac LibraryManagement.java
    
    java LibraryManagement


## 🧪 Sample Menu
  
  ### Library Menu:
    
    1. Add Book
    
    2. Display Books
    
    3. Search Book by Title
    
    4. Exit


## 🔍 Search Functionality
     
      Searches by book title
      
      Case-insensitive comparison
      
      Displays full book details if found


## ⚠️ Limitations
      
      Stores maximum 10 books
      
      Data is not persistent (lost after program exit)
      
      Console-based only (no GUI)


## 🌱 Future Improvements
      
      Use ArrayList instead of fixed arrays
      
      Add file storage (save data permanently)
      
      Separate eBook and PrintedBook using inheritance
      
      Add delete and update options
      
      Create GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX
